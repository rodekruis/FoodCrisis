All;risk_score;Risk score;;decimal2;risk_score.png;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source year.;;This risk score is a 1-10 score which combines all underlying indicators into one index, comparable accross communities. It is made up of three main pillars: vulnerability, hazards exposure and coping capacity. The method and conceptual framework are derived from the INFORM model (www.inform-index.org), which applies it on a national level instead of a sub-national / community level. ;scores;weighted_avg;population;risk_score
